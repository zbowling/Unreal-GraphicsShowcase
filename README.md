# Graphics Showcase

<img src="graphicsShowcase.png">

Tone mapping is a key artistic tool for developers. Graphics Showcase uses a Vulkan subpass-based tone mapping solution that performs much better than traditional methods.

You can also play Graphics Showcase on the [Horizon Store](https://www.meta.com/experiences/graphics-showcase/5543894545665788/) as an APK.
